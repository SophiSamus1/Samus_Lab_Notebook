### For low yield
* incubate RNase free water on column at room temp 5-10 mins before centrifuging to elute
* samples can warm in bead mill and become degraded, keep dwell/pause times to prevent overheating (30 sec inbetween cycles)
*the following do not apply*
* centrifuge after homogenization to avoid pulling pellet/debris into pipette when transferring to column (protocol (link here) already does this)
* increase RNA yield by doubling proteinase K amount (RNeasy protocol (link here) incompatible with prot. K)

### For RNA degradation / smeared bands
*This is my problem*
* electrophoresis equipment may be contaminated with RNases - clean equipment with RNase displace (link?) before use
* It's best to use store bought TAE to avoid RNase contamination in the buffer but we can't so just use new if can (straight from carboy)

### For low performance downstream
*hopefully we won't have that problem, trying to avoid it here, but if it does...*
* during extraction, blot collection tubes with kimwipe after dumping flow-through, before replacing the column to remove residual wash buffer
* add an extra wash step before elution
