## First Time Hotshot Extractions

### Samples:

| Tube # | Sample # |
| ------ | -------- |
|	1	 | 10-0173  |
|	2	 | 10-0174  |
|	3	 | 10--113  |
|	4	 |Thenus#001|
|	5	 | 10-0183  |
|	6	 | 10-0143  |
|	7	 | 10-0140  |


### Materials:
* water (MilliQ)
* 10% Bleach
* 1 M Tris-HCL (pH 8.0)
* 50 mM NaOH
* strip tube
* forceps
* razor blade 

### [Procedure](https://github.com/SophiSamus1/Samus_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/HotshotProtocol.md): 
1. Collect tissue from sample (pencil tip sized amount)
2. Fill tube with 100uL NaOH
3. Place tissue in tube with NaOH
4. Put tubes in PCR machine and use hotshot setting (25 ÂºC for 25 min)
5. add Tris (10% = 10 uL) into tubes
6. place strip tube in plate and place in fridge

Notes: clean workspace with bleach after each sample and replace pipette tip
