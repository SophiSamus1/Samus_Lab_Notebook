### Notes before starting
* clean absolutely everything with RNase displace
	* hood, pencil, ice bucket, bench, pipettes, etc. 
* Incubate nuclease free water on column for 5 mins before elution
* 2 elutions, both 50 ul
* When making gel, clean all equipment with RNase displace

### Samples
| Tube # | Sample # | Tissue (mg) |          About          |                   Notes                   |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |          -----          |                   -----                   |
|	1	 |   G1     |    11       | control, DNA/RNA Shield | 											|
|	2	 |   B016   |    8        | thermal, DNA/RNA Shield | 											|
|	3	 |   B011   |    13       | thermal, DNA/RNA Shield |  dropped tissue on counter like an idiot  |
|	4	 |   B018   |    10       | control, DNA/RNA Shield | 											|
|	5	 |   F6     |    6        | control                 | 											|
|	6	 |   F2     |    13       | thermal, DNA/RNA Shield |  dropped tissue on counter like an idiot  |

*samples out from 2:17pm - 2:56pm*

### Bead Milling
**DTT + RLT working solution = 60 ul DTT + 3 ml RLT**
In the tube: 350 ul working solution + 1.4 mm beads + ~10 mg tissue
*Note: I let the DTT thaw a bit too much. The aliquot used is in the corner of the tray, apart from the two unused. Should probably use unused aliquot for RNAseq samples*

| Tube #	   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| ------------ | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Mill Location| 1 | 13| 7 | 19| 4 | 16|

*Note: sample number 1 got working solution before any of the rest. The rest all got it at the same time after all tissue was prepared. All tissue was kept on ice while preparing samples*

* Bead mill started at 3:22 pm, original tissue samples were returned to -80 and bead tubes filled with working solution shortly before.

 Problems during bead milling:
 * not running for correct amount of time (not accoriding to programmed cycle)
 * I timed cycles manually but first cycle must have been much longer than 45s

 ### RNeasy protocol
 Following protocol (link) with notes:
 1. 15,000 rcf for 3 min (15,000 used for entire protocol)
 2. ~300 ul
 3. 300 ul etoh
 4. 600 ul
 5. 700
 6. 500
 7. 500 2 min. Extra step: new collection tube and extra spin for 1 min to dry column.
 8. 2 50 ul elutions with 5 min room temp incubation on column (5 min from pipetting water onto first column).

 *Note: I dropped sample 4 column on the floor during protocol. get a grip.*
