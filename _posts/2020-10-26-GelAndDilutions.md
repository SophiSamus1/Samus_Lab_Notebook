## Gel for [samples from 10-12 (extractions)](https://github.com/SophiSamus1/Samus_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-10-12-HotshotExtractions.md) and [10-19 (PCR)](https://github.com/SophiSamus1/Samus_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-10-19-PCR.md)

### To make 2% SMALL gel:
* 2 g agarose, 100 mL TAE (buffer)
1. mix agarose and TAE in 500 mL flask
2. microwave ~1 minute (do not let boil)
3. remove using gloves and swirl to mix
4. continue heating at 10-15 second intervals until agarose is completely dissolved
5. let cool  slightly and add 5 uL of smart glow
6. pour gel into small plate and add dividers
7. get rid of any bubbles using pipette tip
8. let set completely in the dark (~30 minutes)

### Running the gel:
1. pipette 8 uL of MM+DNA (PCR product) into wells of the gel
2. pipette 8 ul of 50 bp ladder into one well
3. Run the gel for 30 mins at 85 volts (no more than 100), 0.18 amps, 15 watts (don't change)
	* note: connect red cord to red and black to black
4. Hit start

* \*red is positive, black is negative. DNA needs to be loaded closest to black side\*

Use gel imager and image lab to look at gel.

### Results: did not work, try again with 1.5% gel and only one comb
* 1.5% gel did not work either, do dilutions

## 10x Dilutions
* 2 ul DNA (extraction) and 18 uL milliQ water

PCR MM:
* 10 uL primer F
* 10 uL primer R
* 5 uL BSA
* 100 uL biomix
* 55 uL MilliQ water

C+ = PM9
C- = MilliQ water

18 uL MM + 18 uL H20 + 2 uL DNA per sample [(same samples)](https://github.com/SophiSamus1/Samus_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-10-12-HotshotExtractions.md)
