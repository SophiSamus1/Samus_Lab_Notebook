# HotShot Extraction Protocol

**This procedure should be done in the pre_PCR lab or in the classroom**
**Use strip tubes for HotShot Extractions - they need to go in the thermocycler to incubate**

### You will need:

Equipment and Consumables
* 2 small beakers (50 or 100 mL)
* cutting board
* paper towels
* dissecting forceps (as many as you can find)
* dissecting probes (1 or 2)
* dissecting scissors (2 or 3)
* 0.2 mL strip tubes
* thermocycler
* small centrifuge that can run strip tubes
* pipettes (10 ul and 200 ul)
* pipette tips (10 ul and 200 ul)
* gloves (always)

Chemicals (see locations below)
* 10% bleach (spray bottle or beaker)
* 50 mM NaOH
* 1 M Tris HCL (pH = 8.0)
* deionized (DI) water
* MilliQ water

### Procedure: 

1. Before starting your extractions, use 10% bleach and wipe down the counter/space you will use for extractions (e.g. cutting board/placemat). 
2. Fill one small glass beaker with 10% bleach and one with deionized (DI) water.
3. Rinse/Clean all scissors, probes, forceps with 10% bleach followed by DI water and let dry. CLEAN UTENSILS BETWEEN EACH SAMPLE PROCESSED
4. Add a small piece of tissue to extract into the tube (Tissue from one specimen in each tube).

_**Note**: This shouldn’t take up more than ¼ - ½ of the tube or else it will not get covered by the extraction liquid. (~10mg of tissue – equal or less than QIAGEN/OMEGA extractions). If a larger piece/more tissue is required, add more NaOH in the next step to cover the tissue. Measure the additional amount added and adjust protocol accordingly._

_**Lobster or Crab Tissue**:If you are working with lobster tissue, you can tear paper towels in ½ or 1/3, and use one piece of paper towel per tissue extraction, then throw it away after you have pulled the tissue you need. This facilitates pulling a whole leg or antenna out of the preservation tube and then pulling tissue from it or cutting it in half to pull tissue out or using a razor blade to section the antenna pieces if needed._

_**Fin Clips**: For fin clips, you may be able to just pull the fin clip a bit out of the tube and cut a small piece of it off with a scissors._

_**If your sample was in EtOH, you need to let the EtOH dry off before proceeding**_
5. Add 100ul of 50mM NaOH to each tube. Close each lid of each tube after you add the solution. When finished, make sure all tubes are closed tightly, and centrifuge briefly in the small plastic centrifuge.

_**Note**: NaOH (Sodium hydroxide) is a strong base (pH ~12.7), and the stock is stored in the blue corrosives cabinet. Make sure to aliquot a small (15ml or 50ml) stock for your personal use. DO NOT PIPETTE FROM THE MAIN STOCK._

**Use a thermocycler for incubation step**

6. Incubate at 95°C for 25 minutes. Hold at 15°C for ∞
7. Pull your strip tubes out of the thermocycler when it’s finished/you’re ready, check that the lids are closed tightly, and centrifuge briefly. 
8. Add 10% volume (10ul if you used 100ul of NaOH) of 1M Tris-HCL (pH = 8.0) to each tube (opening/closing one lid at a time if possible)

_**Note**:Tris-HCL is stored in the glass chemical cabinet in the pre-PCR lab. Make sure to aliquot a small (15ml or 50ml) stock for your personal use. DO NOT PIPETTE FROM THE MAIN STOCK._

9. You will likely need to dilute this extracted DNA for it to work in your PCR; HotShot is a dirty extraction method that does not remove the proteins and cell walls from the DNA in the extraction process. 
a. To make a 1:100 dilution, first add 20ul of extracted DNA to 180 ul of MilliQ water. This is a 1:10 dilution.
b. Next, add 5ul of your 1:10 dilution to 45ul of MilliQ water. This is a 1:100 dilution. Most likely your PCR will work at a 1:100 or 1:1000 dilution.
c. If you need a 1:1000 dilution, add 5ul of your 1:100 dilution to 45ul of MilliQ water.
d. 1:10,000 is most likely the furthest dilution worth testing…5ul of 1:1000 dilution in 45ul of MilliQ water.
